# Weather Forecast Visualization

This Python script fetches weather forecast data for a given city from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes the data, and visualizes it using matplotlib. It generates two plots: one for the temperature and one for the humidity, providing a clear and concise forecast.

## Features
- Fetches 5-day weather forecast data.
- Visualizes temperature and humidity forecasts over time.
- Customizable city selection.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- requests
- matplotlib

This Python script provides a way to fetch, process, and visualize weather forecast data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The script is structured into several parts: importing necessary libraries, fetching data from the API, processing the data, and visualizing it through plots.

*1. Libraries Used*
The script makes use of the following libraries:

requests: This library is used to make HTTP requests to external APIs. It helps in sending GET requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieving the weather forecast data in JSON format.
matplotlib.pyplot: This is a plotting library used to create visualizations. Here, it is employed to plot the temperature and humidity data.
datetime: The datetime module helps in converting Unix timestamps into human-readable date-time format.
*2. Fetching Weather Data*
The function fetch_data(city, api_key) is responsible for making a request to the OpenWeatherMap API and fetching the weather forecast data for a specific city.

City and API Key Check: The function first checks if the city name or the API key is missing, printing an error message if either is absent.
URL Construction: The function builds the URL needed to query the OpenWeatherMap API. The URL format includes the city name (city) and the API key (api_key). It also specifies that the units of temperature should be in metric (Celsius) and requests the forecast data for the upcoming days.
Error Handling: The function uses a try block to handle network-related issues using requests.exceptions.RequestException. If the request is successful (i.e., the status code is 200), the JSON data is returned. If there is an error (e.g., wrong city name or API key), the function retrieves and prints the error message from the API response.
*3. Processing the Data*
Once the weather data is fetched, the function process_data(data) is called to extract and organize the relevant information:

Timestamps: The function iterates over the list of weather forecast entries provided in the API response. Each entry has a dt field, which contains the Unix timestamp of the forecast. The function converts each timestamp to a readable date-time format using datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp().
Temperatures and Humidities: The function also extracts the temperature (main['temp']) and humidity (main['humidity']) values for each timestamp and appends them to separate lists (temperatures and humidities).
The function returns three lists:

timestamps: A list of dates/times corresponding to each forecast entry.
temperatures: A list of temperatures in Celsius for each forecast entry.
humidities: A list of humidity percentages for each forecast entry.
*4. Plotting the Data*
The function plot_graph(city, timestamps, temperatures, humidities) is responsible for visualizing the data. It uses matplotlib.pyplot to generate two plots:

Temperature Plot: A line plot is generated for the temperatures. The x-axis represents the dates (timestamps), and the y-axis shows the temperatures in Celsius. The plot is labeled with the title Temperature Forecast for {city} and has the x-label Days and y-label Temperature(Â°C).
Humidity Plot: Similarly, another line plot is generated for the humidity data. The x-axis represents the dates, and the y-axis shows the humidity percentage. The plot is labeled with the title Humidity Forecast for {city} and has the x-label Days and y-label Humidity(%).
Each plot is displayed using plt.show().

*5. User Input and Execution*
The script prompts the user to input the name of the city they want to fetch the weather forecast for.
The api_key is hardcoded in the script as '071564c0a3c3b2f268ef9e25a8bbeeeb', which is used to authenticate the API request.
After the user enters the city name, the script fetches the data, processes it, and generates the plots displaying the weather forecast for the given city.

*6. Limitations*
Error Handling: The error handling in the fetch_data function addresses basic network issues (e.g., no internet connection) and errors returned by the OpenWeatherMap API (e.g., wrong API key, invalid city name). However, more complex error handling could be added to cover other potential issues, such as incorrect data formats or missing fields in the API response. Currently, the script doesn't account for unexpected data or API response changes, which might cause issues during runtime.

API Rate Limits: The OpenWeatherMap API has rate limits for free-tier users, meaning you can only make a limited number of requests within a certain time frame. If the script is used too frequently or if multiple users use the same API key, it could result in hitting these limits, causing the script to fail. To handle this, you could add rate-limiting logic or implement retries with exponential backoff to avoid exceeding the limits.

Data Precision: The script retrieves forecast data for five days at a time, but the data granularity is limited to 3-hour intervals. This means that the forecast data provided may not have the level of detail required for certain applications, especially for users looking for more precise or hourly data. Further improvements could involve requesting more detailed forecasts or using different OpenWeatherMap endpoints that provide higher granularity.

Time Zone Handling: The timestamps returned by the OpenWeatherMap API are in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). However, the script does not account for the local time zone of the city. This could lead to discrepancies when displaying the dates and times in the plot, especially for cities in different time zones. To address this, you could use libraries like pytz or timezone to convert the UTC timestamps to the local time zone of the city.

Visualizations: While the script generates basic temperature and humidity plots, there is room for improvement in terms of the visualization. For instance:

The plots could be made more visually appealing by customizing colors, line styles, and adding legends to make it easier to differentiate between temperature and humidity curves.
The x-axis labels (timestamps) could be formatted to show the date in a more readable format rather than raw timestamps. Additionally, rotating the x-axis labels could prevent overlap when plotting data over several days.
You could add an option to save the generated plots as images (e.g., PNG or JPG) instead of only displaying them, so users can share the visualizations.
API Key Security: As mentioned earlier, the API key is hardcoded in the script, which could pose a security risk, especially if the script is shared publicly. For better security practices, it's better to store the API key in an environment variable or a .env file, which would be loaded dynamically during script execution.

Limited Data Representation: The script currently only handles temperature and humidity data. There are other valuable weather metrics, such as wind speed, pressure, and cloudiness, which could also be included in the plots. Adding additional plots for these parameters would provide users with a more comprehensive view of the forecast.
